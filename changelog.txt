Added two further inlets for setting filter type and order.
Refactored private functions to accept arrays of length n.
Added HPF functions to handle generation of HPF coefficients.
Added functionality to change filter order between 2,3 and 4.

Notes:
3rd order HPF seems to be playing up; not entirely sure why...
